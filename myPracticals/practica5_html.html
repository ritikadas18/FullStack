        Hypertext refers to the way in which web pages(HTML documents) are linked together.Thus,the link available
        on a webpage is called Hypertext.As it name suggests HTML is a markup language which means you use
        HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to 
        display.Originally,HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings 
        and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
